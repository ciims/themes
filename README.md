# CiiMS Themes Repository

This repository contains a collection of all the approved themes for [CiiMS ](https://github.com/charlesportwoodii/ciims), and serves as the primary distribution method for all themes

## How this repository works

This repository contains an ```index.json``` file, which contains a master list of all the approved themes for CiiMS. In the dashboard, when you look to install an new theme, this file is referenced as the master approved list of themes that can be installed through the installer.

## Contributing

To contribute to this repository, first build a theme (see https://github.com/charlesportwoodii/ciims-themes-default as an example of what themes look like). Once you are happy with your theme, tag/version it using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Once versioned, submitted a pull request to this repository. Your pull request should modify ```index.json``` with your card information, and should have the following information at minimum.

```
"ThemeName": {
	"name": "<name_as_defined_in_composer.json>",
	"version": "<semver_tag_version>",
	"repository": "https://github.com/<user>/<repo>"
}
```

A good example is as follows:
```
"Default": {
	"name": "ciims-themes/default",
	"version": "3.0.8",
	"repository": "https://github.com/charlesportwoodii/ciims-themes-default",
},
```
